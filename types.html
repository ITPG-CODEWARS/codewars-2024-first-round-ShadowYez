            <li>High-speed trains
                <h5>High-speed rail systems are designed for efficient long-distance travel. They can reach speeds over 200 km/h on special tracks to reduce fire risks.

                    Japan’s Shinkansen, or bullet train, introduced in 1964, was famous for all types of trains. The Wuhan–Guangzhou High-Speed Railway and Beijing–Tianjin Intercity Rail are the world’s fastest high-speed rails, reaching up to 350 km/h.
                    
                    High-speed trains are environmentally friendly, carrying more passengers with less fuel consumption than airplanes.
                    
                    They save time by avoiding airport procedures like boarding, check-in, takeoff, and disembarking, making travel more efficient and cost-effective.</h5>

            <li>Maglev trains
                <h5>Maglev, short for magnetic levitation, is a transportation system that uses magnets to lift and propel trains without traditional wheels or tracks.

                    This technology eliminates friction and allows for high-speed travel than other types of trains. Maglev trains are smooth, quiet, and quick to accelerate and decelerate.
                    
                    However, there are drawbacks. The construction cost is high, and the energy required to overcome drag and friction is substantial. Additionally, the comfort and safety of passengers are concerns.
                    
                    Maglev trains are operational in only three countries: China, South Korea, and Japan. The benefits of these trains are overshadowed by the associated costs and risks, limiting their widespread adoption.</h5>

            <li>Commuter
                <h5>Regional trains connect suburbs to city centers, mainly for work commuters. They run during weekday rush hours, saving fuel costs by traveling in peak directions.

                    In the US, commuter trains are usually locomotives, while European regional trains have multiple electric units.
                    
                    Commuter trains ease road traffic, reduce pollution, and accommodate standing passengers. Some carriages prioritize standing space over seats and accommodate wheelchairs, cycles, and prams.
                    
                    Cities relying heavily on commuter trains may face congestion. For instance, Tokyo’s Yamanote Line serves 3.5 million daily passengers across 29 stations.
                    
                    New York’s subway carries 5.7 million passengers daily across 472 stations. Modern types of trains have foldable seats, doors on both sides and double-decker options to address crowding.</h5>

            <li>Light Rail
                <h5>Light rail, also known as Light-Rail Transit (LRT) or Electric Trolley System (LRV). It is a fast and efficient way of public transportation.

                    It uses fixed rails and electric-powered single cars or short trains designed for lighter passenger capacity, not  vehicle weight.
                    
                    Light rail includes traditional trams and modern very-light or ultra-light rail systems. Its resurgence is due to recognized health and environmental benefits and its ability to transport many passengers efficiently.
                    
                    Light rail bridges the gap between local buses and heavy rail, providing a flexible solution to commuting challenges.
                    
                    It excels in moving commuters to and from city centers faster than buses while being more cost-effective than heavy rail. It enhances urban mobility and contributes to a sustainable and eco-friendly transportation landscape.</h5>

            <li>Sublay/Metro
            <h5>Metro trains, often known as rapid or mass rapid transit (MRT), provide major cities with efficient, high-capacity public transportation. These types of electric train systems, which use fixed electric tracks, feature fast acceleration and high speeds.

                These metropolitan transit networks can be built above or below ground, and many systems use a combination of both. A subway, tube, or underground is a type of rapid transit system that operates largely underground.</h5>
